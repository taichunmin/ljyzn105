When you want to read a specified tag or a specific tag, you can use the mask or password function.
Open ReaderSoft , then AdvanceSet->Password,  open it and input 8 bit password, then the reader only can read same password with your set. Warning: The label default password is 00000000, you need use Writer to write password first, you can read How to write label file first.

Also you can use Mask function to read specified tag,  AdvanceSet -> Mask , open it then Start(Hex) set 0, then input MaskData(Hex).
Eg:  If you only want to 1122 begin tag,  AdvanceSet -> Mask, open it, then Start(Hex) set 0, then input MaskData as 1122, then click set. After these, the reader only can read such as 11223344,112233456778 like these tag.
